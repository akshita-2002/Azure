# WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING

- to meet the needs of increasing number of users
- to reduce cost
- to manage large amount of data
- pay as you go
- serverless computing 
- infinite storage
- applications can be deployed

- Types of cloud
1. private cloud
2. public cloud 
3. Hybrid cloud   



- Auto Scaling Group (ASG) - if enabled the project will be using auto scaling  

- Active Directory - usernames , passwords are stored in AD. 

## SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE
- the user intervention is less
1. Accessiblity
2. Scalability
3. COst effectiveness

## INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE 

- provides virtualized computing resources such as servers and networking on demand

1. Control - users have great control
2. FLexibility - offers flexibity in resource allocation, scale up or scale down as needed
3. Cost-efficiency


## PLATFORM AS A SERVICE

- provides a cloud based platfrom for developing, deploying and managing applications without complexities 

1. Development 
2. Deployment - testing -> SIT, UAT
3. Management - production -> pre production and production

- we can also combine Iaas, Saas, PaaS

- in abstration , Saas is at highest level , Paas Medium, Iaas lowest



## CHOOSING RIGHT CLOUD MODEL

- Application Complexity -> based on the type of users using the application, turnaround complexity, storage. => Saas is suitable for simpler applications while Paas and Iaas for more complex applications
- control requirements  -> Iaas offers the most control over infrastruture, while Saas provides least
- budget constraints -> Saas has lower upfront cost while Iaas and Paas can have  higher costs.


## Parameters to define whether Iaas,Paas or Saas

1. Severless?
2. deployment - if no then not Paas
3. Application - if yes then Iaas or Saas
4. behaviour
5. infrastructure 




# MICROSOFT AZURE

- cloud platform 
- provides a flexible and sclable platform for businesses of all sizes 

## SERVICES 

1. Compute - VM,Serverless computing, containers ( execute a application on a serverless machine)
2. Storage - blobs,files, queues,tables and disks 
3. Networking - virtual nwtorks , load balancers,vpn gateways for connectivity
4. Security




### AZURE COMPUTE 

- VMs - ondemand, scalable compute instances with a choice of operating system 
- Containers - deploy, manage containerized apps with azure containerized service
- Serverless Computing - run code without managing servers using Azure functions and Azure Logic apps.



### AZURE STORAGE 

- Blob Storage - stores unstructured data like images , vidoes

- File Storage - shares files across diff applications and users

- Queue Storage - handles asynchronous messaging b/w applications

- Table Storage - NoSQL database for structured data 



### AZURE NETWORKING 

- Virtual Networks - private networks in cloud, isolating applications and resources
- Load Balancers - distribute trafiic across multiple instances for high availability 
- VPN Gateways - connect on-premises networks to azure
